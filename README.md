# export_image_to_A4

* This project aims to take any kind of images and, given different pairs of (width, height) values, it rescales the images in such a way that they'd be printable on a A4 sheets (or other AN formats, where N=0,1,2,3,4,..).

* It's designed to operate on a "images" folder containing all of the images that are chosen to be automatically rescaled
